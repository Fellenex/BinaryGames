Original Problem-Domain Description:
<br>
Players play the top card from their deck at the same time laying them on the table from right to left.
<br>
If less than 3 players are playing they should lay down five cards to start.
<br>
If there are 3 or more players you should lay down three cards to start.
<br>
1 (black) beats 0 (white); the player who plays the black card takes both
<br>
If the players play the same card, they place the next 3 cards faceup; the sum of those cards decides the winner.
<br>
Players keep playing until their deck is empty; at that point they take all the cards that they won; this becomes their new deck.
<br>
Gameplay continues until 1 player has all the cards


**TODO:**
*
Seed a game by randomizing and splitting the deck up
<br>
Print statements to trace the pathing of the game
<br>
Split binary deck and game definitions into different files
