Original Problem-Domain Description:
 Players play the top card from their deck at the same time laying them
    on the table from right to left
 If less than 3 players are playing they should lay down five cards to
    start.
 If there are 3 or more players you should lay down three cards to
    start.
 1 (black) beats 0 (white); the player who plays the black card takes
    both
 If the players play the same card, they place the next 3 cards faceup;
    the sum of those cards decides the winner.
 Players keep playing until their deck is empty; at that point they take
    all the cards that they won; this becomes their new deck.
 Gameplay continues until 1 player has all the cards
